# random-choice-picker
A responsive little project for picking random choices, built using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript without the use of frameworks or libraries.  This is part of the 50projects/25days repository inspired by 50projects/50days by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.

Choices can be written in the text area separated by a comma. Under the text area, tags will be generated as soon as you start to type. 

Then pressing enter or picking the button an animation effect will start on the tags and this is going to stop on a random item from your list.
